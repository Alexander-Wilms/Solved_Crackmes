in this crackme the first number can by any number
but the second number must be 2 or 6 or 0
if the first number divisibly by 6 the second number need to be 6
if the first number divisibly by 2 and not divisibly by 6 the second number need 
to be 2
if the first number not divisibly by 2 or 6 the second number need to be zero
for the checking function i used math and bitwise no loop no conditional statements
hope you like it
